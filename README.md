# Quote-It: A Borrower-Lender Web-App

This is a simple peer-to-peer lending platform where borrowers can request loans and lenders can express interest.

## 🚀 Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)** – Fast and modern React framework for building full-stack apps.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling for clean, responsive UI.
- **Supabase** – Auth, database, and backend-as-a-service. Postgres under the hood.
- **Vercel** – Instant deployment and CI/CD for frontend.


## 🧠 How It Works

* Borrowers fill a form to request loans.
* Lenders browse loan cards and register interest.
* Supabase handles auth and stores user/loan data.
* Filtering, sorting, and dynamic UI handled client-side.

## 🛠 Dev Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Make sure to set your Supabase keys in `.env.local`. 
Have fun hacking ✌️
