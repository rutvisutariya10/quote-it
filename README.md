# Quote-It: A Borrower-Lender Web-App

A minimal peer-to-peer lending platform where borrowers post loan requests and lenders express interest, with a little interactive flair.

## ðŸš€ Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)** â€“ A solid choice for full-stack React applications with built-in routing and API support, keeping both client and server logic organized in one codebase.  
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ Offers a utility-first approach to styling that ensures a clean, consistent UI without the need for custom CSS files.  
- **Supabase** â€“ Handles authentication, database, and serverless functions in one platform, making it easy to manage users and data without setting up a separate backend.  
- **Vercel** â€“ Provides a seamless deployment workflow and native support for Next.js, making updates and hosting straightforward.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- Any user can be both- Borrower and Lender
- On the Lender page, users wonâ€™t see their own loan requestsâ€”only those from others.
- Borrowers fill out a form to request a loan.
- Borrowers see their requests as **flip cards**â€” reveals more information when clicked.
- Lenders can see all the Loan Requests from different borrowers (Implemented filters for refined Search).
- Lenders can express interest in loans.
- Supabase handles user auth and stores loan + interest data.
- Borrowers can view how many lenders are interested, and see **masked email IDs** (e.g., `joh*****@gmail.com`).

## ðŸ›  Dev Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
````

Set your Supabase keys in `.env.local`.
