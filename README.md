# Quote-It: A Borrower-Lender Web-App

A minimal peer-to-peer lending platform where borrowers post loan requests and lenders express interestâ€”with a little interactive flair.

## ðŸš€ Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)** â€“ Full-stack React with modern routing.
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ Utility-first styling for responsive, clean UI.
- **Supabase** â€“ Auth, Postgres database, and serverless functions.
- **Vercel** â€“ Fast deployments with CI/CD.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- Any user can be both- Borrower and Lender
- On the Lender page, users wonâ€™t see their own loan requestsâ€”only those from others.
- Borrowers fill out a form to request a loan.
- Borrowers see their requests as **flip cards**â€” reveals more information when clicked.
- Lenders can see all the Loan Requests from different borrowers (Implemented filters for refined Search).
- Lenders can express interest in loans.
- Supabase handles user auth and stores loan + interest data.
- Borrowers can view how many lenders are interested, and see **masked email IDs** (e.g., `joh*****@gmail.com`).

## ðŸ›  Dev Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
````

Set your Supabase keys in `.env.local`.
